My conky theme
## Description
I created this basic [Conky theme](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky) to give me a quick system status of my Linux Mint desktop.
## Installation
Copy the [.conkyrc](src/.conkyrc) file to the user's home directory. So long as conky is running then the theme file should be picked up automatically.
